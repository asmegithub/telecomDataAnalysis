# Scripts Directory

This directory contains various scripts used in the AI project for week 2. Below is a brief description of each script:

## Files

### `data_preprocessing.py`
This script is responsible for cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. It handles missing values, normalizes data, and performs feature engineering.


### `data_visualization.py`
This script creates visualizations to help understand the data and the results of the models. It includes plots such as histograms, scatter plots, and confusion matrices.

### `utils.py`
This script contains utility functions that are used across other scripts. These functions include data loading, saving models, and other helper functions.

## Usage

To run any of these scripts, navigate to the `scripts` directory and execute the desired script using Python. For example:

```bash
cd /home/asmarez/projects/AI/week-2/scripts
python data_preprocessing.py
```

Make sure to install all required dependencies before running the scripts. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file located in the root directory of the project.
